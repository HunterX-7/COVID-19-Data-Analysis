<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 COVID-19 Data Analysis <a name="about-project"></a>

The COVID-19 Data Analysis project is an in-depth exploration conducted in Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Leveraging powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the study aims to establish a correlation between the COVID infection rate and the World Happiness Record, a dataset endorsed by the United Nations. The analysis delves into various variables, including GDP per capita, to decipher meaningful patterns and relationships.
